## Description of the data present in `inst/extdata`

Within the `extdata` there are two folders called: "fcs_index_sorting" and "sorted_sangerseq". These are two different datasets which are integrated using this package. This data was added to the package because the integrating of single-cell sorted cells need to be paired with the correct sequence, the only way I can assure that is using our own datasets.

	* "fcs_index_sorting": contains flow cytometry data, specifically from BD LSR Fortessa cytometer, but all flow cytometries output a index files when sorting single-cells into a plate. These files have a `.fcs` file extension and are used in other other softwares for gating strategies and single-cell analysis by flow cytometry. Everytime a new sample is added or plates are swapped, a new index file is generated by flow cytometers, these files contain the an identification, a sample ID defined by the user and a number. The files in this folder were renamed according to that, to contain only the ID numbers and the unessary long name was removed since it is not useful. In this case, what is usually "SPECIMEM_INX_FILE_E18_001.fcs" was renamed as "E18_C1.fcs" as an example. 
	
	* "sorted_sangerseq": within this folder, there are subfolders named `E18_C1` and `E18_C1_R`, which uses the same nomenclature from the index files. The `E18_C1` folder contains results from sanger sequencing from a sequenced plate from the paired data of the single-cell sorted B cells in the flow cytometry data.  The E18_C1_R contains some samples that were resequenced in the attempt to get better sequence quality, thus the package also aims to select the sequence with the best quality score if they were repeated. The files within these folders came from a ABI sanger sequencing machine, these machines are used for sequecing an entire plate and it automatically adds a well ID name in front of the resulting ABI files. For that reason, the package uses this nomenclature to grasp the well location of the sequence to be further on integrated with the flow cytometry data.

Both datasets were generated from rhesus macaque following vaccination against RSV, the sorted cells were B cells that were probed to be vaccine-specific and placed in a 96-well plate that was further sequenced.
